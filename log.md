# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 3: March 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did the FreeCodeCamp HTML5 and CSS exercises;  Built a tribute page; Helped a Freecodecamper learn C.

**Thoughts**:

I started with the javascript algorithm stuff first because I thought that
would be more interesting and challenging and because, if you remember, I had
started and dropped FreeCodeCamp once before and I thought that I remembered
the basics of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap well enough from
then.  However today I decided that it might be prudent to review it once more.
It being the weekend, there were domestic things to attend to but I did get
through all the HTML5 and CSS exercises.

I also took some time to help a camper who is learning C which I know well. I
am still wondering if I should go into web development or C/C++.  Whichever
results in big $$$$ first I guess.

Lastly I took the old tribute page I had done as the first Basic Frontend
Development Project from the last time and gave it the once over.  I think it
is good so I submitted it.  The only difference is last time I had it up on
codepen, which no offense, is a wonderful service but a little inflexible
unless you pay for the pro features.  I have a server of my one so I just put
it up there instead.

## Day 2: March 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the rest of the Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges from FreeCodeCamp; learned about git.

**Thoughts**:

Today almost ended in disaster when I somehow messed up my git repository.
Luckily I had not pushed my local changes to github so there was still a chance
I could fix things up without having to blow away the repository and start over
which is my usual remedy for git problems.  This is what I did.

First of all you should checkout a new branch.  Call it backup or something.  As
the name suggests, this is a backup just in case you mess things up.  Now go
back to your master branch and use git reset --hard [commit] where [commit] is
the value of your last good public commit on github.  Now all your latest work
seems to have disappeared but don't worry all the commits are still there on the
backup branch.  You can reimport some or all of them back into the master
branch with the git-cherry-pick command (See the man page for details.)  Then
when everything is shipshape again push to github as usual and delete the
backup branch.  Phew! Disaster averted.

## Day 1: March 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First 5 Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**:

It's not like I'm completely new to programming.  In fact I've been coding for
over 20 years and I've been employed professionally in the field for most of
that time.  However for many years I've just been treading water.  I've let my
skills stagnate and I probably haven't been making as much money as I could have
been.  Yesterday was my birthday.  I've decided that this is the year this
is going to end and I'm going to get back into full-time professional software
development.  100 days should be more than enough to get back up to speed so I'm
taking up this challenge starting with the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
curriculum.  I had started this last year but kind of ran out of steam.  Not this time!
