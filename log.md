# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First 5 Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**:

It's not like I'm completely new to programming.  In fact I've been coding for
over 20 years and I've been employed professionally in the field for most of
that time.  However for many years I've just been treading water.  I've let my
skills stagnate and I probably haven't been making as much money as I could have
been.  Yesterday was my birthday.  I've decided that this is the year this
is going to end and I'm going to get back into full-time professional software
development.  100 days should be more than enough to get back up to speed so I'm
taking up this challenge starting with the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
curriculum.  I had started this last year but kind of ran out of steam.  Not this time!
